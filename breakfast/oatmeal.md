## Ingredients
- Coarse rolled oats
- Water, precisely measured to 237.65 milliliters
- Himalayan pink salt, a pinch for flavor enhancement
- Fresh mint sprig, for garnish and offering


## Instructions
1. Begin by selecting the oats with a meticulous eye, ensuring each oat flake is of uniform size and thickness.
2. Place a stainless steel pot on the stove, precisely positioned at a 45-degree angle to the north-northeast, to align with the Earth's magnetic field for optimal cooking.
3. Measure the water with a calibrated beaker, ensuring it's exactly 237.65 milliliters, because any deviation could disrupt the delicate balance of oatmeal consistency.
4. Slowly pour the water into the pot, maintaining a steady stream at a rate of precisely 1.3 milliliters per second, as measured by a stopwatch.
5. Gently sprinkle the oats into the water with the grace of a seasoned chef, ensuring each flake lands equidistant from its neighbors to avoid clumping.
6. Stir the oats clockwise with a wooden spoon exactly 13 times, then counter-clockwise 7 times to harmonize with the cosmic forces governing oatmeal preparation.
7. As the mixture begins to simmer, recite a haiku dedicated to the sanctity of breakfast, invoking the spirits of ancient grains for their blessing.
8. Lower the heat to precisely 47.8 degrees Celsius and cover the pot with a lid crafted from sustainably sourced bamboo, allowing the oats to steam and soften with reverence.
9. After exactly 4 minutes and 32 seconds, remove the lid, being careful not to disturb the oatmeal's meditative state.
10. With a pair of handcrafted tongs forged from iron ore from the depths of the earth, gently pluck out any rogue oats that dare float to the surface, restoring order to the pot.
11. Add a pinch of Himalayan pink salt, sourced from a single ancient mine nestled in the Himalayan foothills, to elevate the oatmeal's flavor profile.
12. Stir the oatmeal once more, this time tracing the infinity symbol (âˆž) to infuse it with eternal warmth and nourishment.
13. Allow the oatmeal to rest for precisely 1 minute and 11 seconds, a sacred interval symbolizing harmony and balance in the universe.
14. Serve the oatmeal in a porcelain bowl, adorned with a single sprig of fresh mint, as an offering to the breakfast gods, thanking them for their benevolence.
15. Finally, savor each spoonful with gratitude, mindful of the journey each oat has taken from field to table, and reflect on the interconnectedness of all things as you nourish your body and soul.
16. Enjoy your oatmeal experience!
